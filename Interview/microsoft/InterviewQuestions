Y    19 A question related to the MS Paint. Given a grid of N*N, some of the cells are colored to create a bounded figure. Similar to MS paintâ€™s fill colour functionality, when I click a cell (x, y) outside the bounded figure all the cells outside it should be coloured with the new colour, similarly inside. Similar to this link, but since it was a bounded figure I recursed it for all 8 directions.  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flood-fill-algorithm-implement-fill-paint/
